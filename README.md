### Image classification with CNN Model


CNNs are a cornerstone of modern AI, excelling in tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. This article explores CNN basics, practical applications, and how to implement them using popular datasets and frameworks, providing a comprehensive guide to mastering this essential deep learning technology

### Dataset 
##### Content
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
